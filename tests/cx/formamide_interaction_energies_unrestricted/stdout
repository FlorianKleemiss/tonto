====================================
Basis set linear dependence analysis
====================================

. Linear dependence is detected by small overlap matrix eigenvalues

. Overlap matrix eigenfunctions with eigenvalues less than the
  linear_dependence_tolerance are projected out of the AO basis
  leading to, in this case, some exact-zero MO eigenvalues.

Min. overlap matrix eigenvalue .... 0.240549E-01
Linear dependence tolerance ....... 0.100000E-04
Linear dependence shift ........... 0.100000E+13
No. of small eigenvalues .......... 0
No. of negative eigenvalues ....... 0

Quantum mechanical interaction energies
=======================================

. E_pro-supermol(non-orthog) = E(Psi) where Psi = Psi_1 Psi_2
. is the non-orthogonal pro-supermolecule product wavefunction

. E_pro-supermol(orthog) = E(Psi) where Psi = A(Psi_1 Psi_2)
  is the antisymmetrized normalized pro-supermolecule wavefunction

. Delta E_X = E_X(Psi) - E_X(Psi_1) - E_X(Psi_2) where the
  terms on the right are calculated as  expectation values of
  of operators X which are the subterms of the Hamiltonian

. This dcomposition was first defined by Kitaura & Morokuma.
  The code follows: P. Su and H. Li (2009) JCP 131 p. 014102.
  See there for references, or Stone's 'Intermolecular Forces'.

. NOTE: E_pro-supermol(orthog) is the only QM valid number since
  it arises from an antisymmetric wavefunction; however the non-
  orthogonal promolecule does produce good electronic densities
  for use in X-ray crystallography, so the sub terms which come
  from it, produce here, may also be reasonable.

. NOTE: The energies here always apply to determinant orbital
  wavefunctions NOT correlated density matrices. However for
  correlated wavefunctions the highest occupied natural orbitals
  (HONOs) are used instead of the molecular orbitals (MOs).
