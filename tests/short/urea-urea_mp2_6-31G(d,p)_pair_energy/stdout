============================
Classical interaction energy
============================

This evaluates the classical coulomb interaction energy:

. between the fragment density matrices which comes from
  a product wavefunction Psi = Psi_1 Psi_2
  >>> OR <<<
. from any correlated subsystem density matrices. In the
  latter case the total density matrix is the sum of the
  subsytem densities.

. Delta E_X = E_X(Psi) - E_X(Psi_1) - E_X(Psi_2)
  where the terms on the right are calculated as
  expectation vaues of the respective operators X

1. Delta E_nn-repulsion ...................       72.658867
2. Delta E_en-attraction ..................     -145.350422
3. Delta E_ee-repulsion ...................       72.690509

Delta E_coulomb   (1+2+3) .................       -0.001046
Delta E_coulomb (kJ/mol) ..................       -2.745551

=======================================
Quantum mechanical interaction energies
=======================================

. E_pro-supermol(non-orthog) = E(Psi) where Psi = Psi_1 Psi_2
. is the non-orthogonal pro-supermolecule product wavefunction

. E_pro-supermol(orthog) = E(Psi) where Psi = A(Psi_1 Psi_2)
  is the antisymmetrized normalized pro-supermolecule wavefunction

. Delta E_X = E_X(Psi) - E_X(Psi_1) - E_X(Psi_2) where the
  terms on the right are calculated as  expectation values of
  of operators X which are the subterms of the Hamiltonian

. This dcomposition was first defined by Kitaura & Morokuma.
  The code follows: P. Su and H. Li (2009) JCP 131 p. 014102.
  See there for references, or Stone's 'Intermolecular Forces'.

. NOTE: E_pro-supermol(orthog) is the only QM valid number since
  it arises from an antisymmetric wavefunction; however the non-
  orthogonal promolecule does produce good electronic densities
  for use in X-ray crystallography, so the sub terms which come
  from it, produce here, may also be reasonable.

. NOTE: The energies here always apply to determinant orbital
  wavefunctions NOT correlated density matrices. However for
  correlated wavefunctions the highest occupied natural orbitals
  (HONOs) are used instead of the molecular orbitals (MOs).
